This project is created using Python 3, Docker Toolbox and the Flask framework(http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/).

Initial architecture based on the guide found here: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/23/build-a-simple-crud-app-with-flask-and-python
    Note, I will update this as each piece is finalized.


Initial container setup used this guide, with modifications: https://medium.com/bitcraft/dockerizing-a-python-3-flask-app-line-by-line-400aef1ded3a
